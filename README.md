# NotesAndTagsApp
Designed and developed a versatile notes and tags application, enabling users to efficiently organize and manage their information with ease.

Crafted during my early stages of learning, this application represents a foundational level system for managing notes and user authentication within web environments.

The Notes and Tags application is designed using ASP.NET Core, offering essential functionalities for note management. It enables users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on notes, ensuring seamless organization and access to essential information. Leveraging JWT (JSON Web Tokens), the application guarantees secure access to its endpoints, enhancing data protection and user privacy.

Additionally, the application includes a UserController responsible for user authentication tasks. Users can register accounts and log in securely, enhancing the overall user experience and fostering a sense of personalization within the system.

Employing a RESTful API architecture, the application ensures efficient communication between client and server, facilitating smooth data exchange. Despite being developed at a beginner level, the application serves as a valuable learning experience, providing practical insights into ASP.NET Core development, RESTful API design, and JWT-based authentication.

Through the development of this application, I gained hands-on experience in translating theoretical knowledge into tangible solutions, sharpening my programming skills and deepening my understanding of web development principles. While the application may have its limitations, it represents a significant milestone in my journey as a developer, reflecting my dedication to continuous learning and improvement.
